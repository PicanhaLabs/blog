Today I was watching a [talk of a friend of mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfZRsMkzVLM) about front end architeture for high scalable systems. And in the beginning he talked, among other things, about why they support IE8-9.

Basically he used the most common argument for justifying their choice: *These IE versions represents good part of our company's revenues.*

And this argument is not bad. You can say "but these companies delay web evolution" or "not even Microsoft support this version anymore". And you are not wrong. But you are argumenting money with philosophy, and cannot convince CEO's with a beautiful history =(.

Otherwise you can always try to find a flaw in *money's argumment*.
